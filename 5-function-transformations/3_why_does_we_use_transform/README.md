# Why Transform?
You might be wondering:
* "When would I use function transformations in the real world?"
* "Isn't it simpler to just define functions at the top level of the code, and call them as needed?"

Good questions. To be clear, we don't just transform functions at [runtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing)#Runtime) for the fun of it! We use advanced techniques like function transformation only when they make our code *simpler than it would otherwise be*.

## Code Reusability
Creating variations of the same function dynamically can make it a lot easier to share common functionality. Take a look at this `formatter` function. It accepts a "pattern" and returns a new function that formats text according to that pattern:
```python
from collections.abc import Callable

def formatter(pattern: str) -> Callable[[str], str]:
    def inner_func(text: str) -> str:
        result: str = ""
        i: int = 0
        while i < len(pattern):
            if pattern[i:i+2] == '{}':
                result += text
                i += 2
            else:
                result += pattern[i]
                i += 1
        return result
    return inner_func
```

Now we can create new formatters easily:
```python
bold_formatter: Callable[[str], str] = formatter("**{}**")
italic_formatter: Callable[[str], str] = formatter("*{}*")
bullet_point_formatter: Callable[[str], str] = formatter("* {}")
```

And use them like this:
```python
print(bold_formatter("Hello"))
# **Hello**
print(italic_formatter("Hello"))
# *Hello*
print(bullet_point_formatter("Hello"))
# * Hello
```

## Closures
90% of the time, when I use function transformations, it's because I want to create a closure. We'll talk about closures in the next chapter!
