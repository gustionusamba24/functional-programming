# Statements vs. Expressions
Studying functional programming is really about returning to the most basic aspects of programming and looking at them in a new way. [Statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science)) and [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)) are a great example of that.

## Statements
"Statements" are actions to be carried out. For example:
- "Set `n` to `7`"
- "Define a function named `greet`"
- "If `x > 10`, `print` a greeting to Alice"

In Python, such statements look like this:
```
n: int = 7  # Variable assignment statement

def greet(name: str) -> str:  # Function definition statement
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if x > 10:  # `if` statement
    print(greet("Alice"))

for i in range(n):  # `for` loop statement
    print(i)
```

**Every complete instruction is a statement.**

## Expressions
Expressions are a subset of statements that produce values. Evaluating an expression results in a value that can be used in whatever way is needed. It can be assigned to a variable, returned from a function, etc.
```
result: int = 2 + 2  # Arithmetic expression
length: int = len("hello")  # Function call expression
total_cost: float = len(items) * cost  # Multiple expressions combined into one
```

One thing that may surprise you is that, in most languages (including Python), every function call is an expression. When you call a function, it returns a value – whether or not you realize it or do anything with that value.

Even if a Python function doesn't have a `return` statement, it still implicitly returns `None`. You can test this by assigning a `print` call to a variable:
```
x: None = print("hello")  # hello
print(x)                  # None
```
Sure enough: `print`, the first function we all learn, technically returns a value.

## Expressions Over Statements
Because expressions always produce values, they're reusable and declarative. You can compose expressions and nest them within each other – but you can't always do that with other kinds of statements.

**Functional programming encourages the use of expressions over statements** where possible, because expressions tend to minimize side effects, and make the code easier to reason about. For example, a function that returns a sum is an expression:
```
total: int = sum([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

We can get the same result with a loop, but that involves a series of statements:
```
total: int = 0
for n in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
    total += n
```

Again, it's simple to combine expressions:
```
print(sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) * 2)  # 20
```

But we can't really do the same thing with our series of statements:
```
# This doesn't work!
print((
total = 0
for n in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
    total += n
) * 4)
```

Expressions tend to be concise and logically pure. Some languages that are designed for functional programming, like Haskell, treat everything as an expression. In those languages, even control flow constructs like if and case are expressions that return values.
